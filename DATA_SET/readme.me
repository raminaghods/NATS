In this folder, we are providing a dataset we have created in our UE4 environment that provides examples of objects in the environment with their distance
from the camera.
We randomly placed a large number of people and animals in our UE4 environment. We then using AirSim generated images and depth maps from the created environment.

For each png picture, the pfm file with the same name provides the depth map for that picture. The file "pdf_of_YOLOConfidence.py" in Unreal folder shows how 
to use this dataset.
